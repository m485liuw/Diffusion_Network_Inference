For Newton's method:
Run estimate_helper.m first then newton.m

CVX: the result I got is saved in saveCVX.mat.
If you wanna run:
Run main.m
CVX is needed for NetRate to work. CVX for Windows is available at http://cvxr.com/cvx/cvx.zip 
and for Unix (Linux, MACOSX) at http://cvxr.com/cvx/cvx.tar.gz.
